# Android_Project_Team3_Lal

Thanks for  Reading our README.md 
, 
We are a team of 4 developing an android application under the guidance of Dr.Ratan Lal.This application is  called as Encrypted Messenger which works in Android 5.0(lollipop) and higher for developing this application we have used Linear, Relative, Constraint layouts.

Introduction to our application

This application will Encrypt the message text on the device before sending the message to the sender  and the Decryption and verification will be done on the receiver side with this Encrypted Messenger application .
For secure messaging between the sender and receiver side by using this application with the help of Advanced Encryption Standard and Data Encryption Standard and RSA algorithm (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Algorithms

Sequence Information:
> The first step is the login page if we are new user we can register by clicking the Sign Up Now  button .
>After successful login we can see the home page with four different algorithms page Like AES, DES, RSA, MD5 Algorithms
> By clicking on each algorithm page it will redirect to the specific algorithm page there we can see the Enter text button to encryprt the message
>And if you want to send the output click on SEND button it redirected to the sharing options like bluetooth, sms etc.,
> By clicking on the reset password button it will take to the reset password page
>By clicking on the About it will redirect to the  about app page
>After clicking on logout and sign into the admin page it will redirect to admin page
